# Public-key encryption

Equipped with the mathematical tools developed in the previous two
chapters, we are now in a position to introduce the concept of
public-key cryptography, and present some of the best-known
constructions in this setting. More precisely, we will learn about:

-   The paradigm of public-key cryptography.

-   The RSA encryption scheme and its security.

## Public-key cryptography

In Section \@ref(introduction-to-security), we introduced a symmetric
encryption scheme, in which two parties use a shared secret key to
communicate privately. We still have not solved the problem of
establishing this common key in a secure way. We will now introduce a
new type of encryption scheme, which stems from the following idea: what
if we don't need a shared secret key to have secure communications? This
idea was introduced by Diffie and Hellman in the renowned paper *New
directions in cryptography*,[^26] which is considered to be the birth of
modern cryptography.

They introduced the notion of *asymmetric* or *public-key* encryption,
which on a high level works as follows. Imagine that Alice wishes to
send a message to Bob. Bob produces two keys $\mathsf{pk}$ and
$\mathsf{sk}$, crafted in such a way that whatever is encrypted with
$\mathsf{pk}$ can be decrypted only with $\mathsf{sk}$. That is, for any
message $\mathsf{m}$,
$$\mathsf{Dec}_{\mathsf{sk}}\left(\mathsf{Enc}_{\mathsf{pk}}(\mathsf{m})\right)=\mathsf{m}.$$
Then Bob publishes $\mathsf{pk}$, so that anyone can know it, and keeps
$\mathsf{sk}$ secret. For this reason, $\mathsf{pk}$ is known as Bob's
*public key* and $\mathsf{sk}$ is Bob's *secret key*.

::: {.definition}
*An* asymmetric (or public-key) encryption scheme *is
composed of three efficient algorithms:*
$$(\mathsf{KeyGen},\mathsf{Enc},\mathsf{Dec}).$$

-   *The $\mathsf{KeyGen}$ algorithm chooses two keys
    $\mathsf{pk},\mathsf{sk}$ of length $\lambda$, according to some
    probability distribution, and such that
    $$\mathsf{Dec}_{\mathsf{sk}}\left(\mathsf{Enc}_{\mathsf{pk}}(\mathsf{m})\right)=\mathsf{m}.$$*

-   *The $\mathsf{Enc}$ algorithm uses the public key $\mathsf{pk}$ to
    encrypt a message $\mathsf{m}$, and outputs the encrypted message
    $$\mathsf{c}=\mathsf{Enc}_{\mathsf{pk}}(\mathsf{m}).$$*

-   *The $\mathsf{Dec}$ algorithm uses the secret key $\mathsf{sk}$ to
    decrypt an encrypted message $\mathsf{c}$, recovering $\mathsf{m}$
    as $$\mathsf{Dec}_{\mathsf{sk}}(\mathsf{c})=\mathsf{m}.$$*

*In this context, $\mathsf{m}$ is called the* plaintext*, and
$\mathsf{c}$ is said to be its corresponding* ciphertext*. The keys
$\mathsf{pk}$ and $\mathsf{sk}$ are the* public key *and* secret key*,
respectively.*
:::

Note that, for such a construction to be secure, we need that the secret
key cannot be efficiently computed from the public key. Otherwise, since
the public key is known to everybody, in particular attackers, this
could be exploited to recover the secret key and decrypt any message.

Another difference with symmetric encryption is that the structure of
the keys is different. In symmetric encryption, we had a key associated
to two parties, Alice and Bob, which was used to send messages both
ways. But, in the explanation above, we just described how Alice sends
messages to Bob, but not the other way around. Note that if Bob tried to
use $\mathsf{sk}$ to encrypt, with the hope that Alice decrypts with
$\mathsf{pk}$, then anybody would be able to decrypt, since
$\mathsf{pk}$ is public. Therefore, Alice needs another pair of keys,
one public that is used for everybody else to encrypt messages to Alice,
and one secret, that is used by Alice to decrypt messages addressed to
her.

This might seem like a downgrade, since before we needed only one key
and now we have four in total. We emphasize, however, that none of the
secret keys need to be shared, and the public ones can be shared through
an insecure channel. Moreover, we actually have less keys in the
asymmetric case when many parties are involved, as is highlighted by the
following exercise.

::: {.exercise}
*Suppose that we have $n$ parties, and each of them
wishes to communicate with all the others. Compute how many keys are
needed if they use:*

2.  *A public-key encryption scheme.*
:::

## The RSA encryption scheme

Although Diffie and Hellman introduced the idea of public-key encryption
in 1976, it was not until 1978 that Rivest, Shamir and Adleman published
the first public-key encryption scheme, which became known as the RSA
encryption scheme.[^27] The scheme works as follows.

-   $\mathsf{KeyGen}$: on input a security parameter $\lambda$, choose
    two uniformly random prime numbers $p,q$ of bitlength $\lambda/2$,
    and let $N=pq$. We will work in $\mathbb{Z}_N$, and call $N$ an *RSA
    modulus*. Choose $e\in\mathbb{Z}_N$, and compute
    $$d\equiv e^{-1}\pmod{\varphi(N)}.$$ Output the public key
    $$\mathsf{pk}=(N,e),$$ and the secret key $$\mathsf{sk}=d.$$ Note
    that it is crucial that $p,q$ are uniformly random, whereas $e$ can
    be a fixed parameter.[^28]

-   $\mathsf{Enc}$: given a message $\mathsf{m}\in\mathbb{Z}_N$, and the
    receiver's public key $(N,e)$, output a ciphertext
    $$\mathsf{m}^{e}\bmod{N}.$$

-   $\mathsf{Dec}$: given a ciphertext $\mathsf{c}$ and the secret key
    $d$, output $$\mathsf{c}^{d}\bmod{N}.$$

There are a few things to consider here. The first is, why does this
even work? That is, how can we be sure that the original message is
recovered after encryption and decryption. We observe that, given a
message $\mathsf{m}$, we have that
$$\mathsf{Dec}_{\mathsf{sk}}(\mathsf{Enc}_{\mathsf{pk}}(\mathsf{m}))=\mathsf{Dec}_{\mathsf{sk}}(\mathsf{m}^e\bmod{N})=\left(\mathsf{m}^{e}\right)^d\bmod{N}=\mathsf{m}^{ed}\bmod{N}.$$
Now, we use that $$d\equiv e^{-1}\pmod{\varphi(N)},$$ which means that
there is an integer $k$ such that $$de=k\varphi(N)+1.$$ Thus, by
plugging this into the expression above, we have
$$\mathsf{m}^{ed}\bmod{N}=\mathsf{m}^{k\varphi(N)+1}\bmod{N}=\left(\left(\mathsf{m}^{\varphi(N)}\right)^k\cdot\mathsf{m}\right)\bmod{N}.$$
Finally, we use Euler's theorem
(Proposition \@ref(prp:euler)) and
Proposition \@ref(prp:primitive), which tell us that
$$\mathsf{m}^{\varphi(N)}\bmod{N}=1,$$ and therefore
$$\mathsf{m}^{ed}\bmod{N}=\mathsf{m}.$$ This proves that decryption
indeed reverses encryption.

A second consideration is: are the three algorithms involved efficient?
It is easy to see that $\mathsf{Enc}$ and $\mathsf{Dec}$ are efficient,
since they amount to one modular exponentiation each, which we have seen
that is an efficient computation
(Section \@ref(efficient-modular)). Let us analyze the
$\mathsf{KeyGen}$ algorithm by breaking it into these steps:

1.  Sample prime numbers of size $\lambda$.

2.  Compute $N=pq$.

3.  Compute $\varphi(N)$.

4.  Compute the inverse of $e$ modulo $\varphi(N)$.

Step (1) can be further broken into two parts: sample a random number of
length $\lambda$, and recognize whether it is a prime or not. We know we
can sample random numbers efficiently and, as discussed in
Section \@ref(integer-arithmetic) and Appendix \@ref(primality-testing), there are efficient algorithms to
determine the primality of a number.[^29]

So the strategy is to sample random numbers until we find a prime. But
how many tries do we need? The prime number theorem
(Proposition \@ref(prp:pnt)) tells us that, for large numbers,
the amount $\pi(n)$ of primes up to $n$ is roughly $n/\log n$ which
means that the probability of a random number being a prime is
approximately $1/\log n$. This means that, on average, we will need
$\log n=O(\lambda)$ tries before finding a prime. Thus, the total cost
of step (1) is $O(\lambda^3)$.

Step (2) is simple arithmetic, which is efficient. Computing $\phi(N)$
in step (3) is easy when knowing the factorization of $N$ since, if
$N=pq$, then $$\varphi(N)=(p-1)(q-1),$$ as a consequence of
Proposition \@ref(prp:totient). Finally, step (4) can be performed efficiently
using the Euclidean algorithm.

The following Sage code is a very simple implementation of the three
algorithms composing the RSA encryption scheme.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Set a security parameter
sec_param = 1024

### KEY GENERATION 
# Generate two prime numbers of length sec_param/2
p = random_prime(2^(sec_param/2-1),2^(sec_param/2)-1)
q = random_prime(2^(sec_param/2-1),2^(sec_param/2)-1)
# Set the RSA modulus:
N = p*q
# Compute Euler's phi function on N:
phi = (p-1)*(q-1)
# Define Z_N, so that all operations are
# automatically reduced modulo N.
Z = Integers(N)
# Choose a public key:
e = 2^16 + 1
# Compute the corresponding secret key:
d = inverse_mod(e,phi)       # Euclidean algorithm is used under the hood.

### ENCRYPTION - using pk = (N,e)
# Choose a message to encrypt.

# Check that the message fits in Z_N.
if (m >= N):
    print("Message too large.")
else:
    # Encrypt the message
    c = Z(m)^e     # Z(m) is written instead of m so that Sage recognizes m 
                   # as an element of Z_N, and performs operations modulo N.
    print("c = "+str(c))


### DECRYPTION - using sk = d
m = Z(c)^d
print("m = "+str(m))
```

*In the code above, can we replace the line about
computing $\varphi(N)$ by `phi = euler_phi(N)`?*

## Security of RSA

So we know that the scheme works and is efficient. It remains to discuss
security. As mentioned above, the secret key should be hard to deduce
from the public key, otherwise anyone would have access to it, and thus
anyone would be able to decrypt.

By looking again at the generation of the secret key in
$\mathsf{KeyGen}$, we observe that it can be computed from $e$ and
$\varphi(N)$. The parameters $e$ and $N$ are public, so what prevents
attackers from computing the secret key? The crucial point is that, in
$\mathsf{KeyGen}$, we were able to compute $\varphi(N)$ from the
*factorization* $(p,q)$ of $N$, by computing $$\varphi(N)=(p-1)(q-1).$$
However, if we do not know the factors of $N$, we cannot carry out this
computation. Moreover, this works both ways: it can be shown that
knowledge of $\varphi(N)$ allows to factor $N$ efficiently. Thus, the security of RSA relies on the hardness of factorization.

::: {.definition}
*Let $p,q$ be large prime numbers, and let $N=pq$. The* factorization problem *consists of recovering $p,q$, given* $N$.
:::

As mentioned in
Section \@ref(integer-arithmetic), there is no known algorithm for
factoring a product of two large primes efficiently.

Hardness of factorization is a necessary condition for security but,
unfortunately, not a sufficient one. That is, an adversary could still
in principle decrypt a ciphertext without the need of the secret key,
with some other technique. This motivates the introduction of the
following problem.

::: {.definition}
*Let $p,q$ be large primes, and let $N=pq$. Let
$e\in\mathbb{Z}_N$. The* RSA problem *consists of recovering
$\mathsf{m}\in\mathbb{Z}_N$, given $N,e$ and $\mathsf{m}^e\bmod{N}$.*
:::

Clearly if factorization is easy then the RSA problem is also easy, but
the implication in the other direction is not known to be true or false
so far. However, as is the case with the factorization problem, there
have been extensive attacks against the RSA problem, and no better
attack than factorization of $N$ has been found. This provides a
reasonable guarantee that the problem is indeed hard, even if we lack a
formal proof.

For security against current computational power, most organizations
suggest a security parameter of at least $\lambda=2048$ (see
<https://www.keylength.com/>). That is, an RSA modulus $N$ of bitlength
$2048$ is believed to be secure against current factorization attempts.
To date, the highest RSA modulus to be factored has bitlength $829$, and
took about $2700$ core-years.[^30]

![Webcomic by xkcd (<https://xkcd.com/538/>).](security.png)

So is this enough to call the RSA scheme secure? Unfortunately, no,
since it is vulnerable to other attacks that do not depend on recovering
the secret key. We consider the following scenario: suppose that Alice
is sending Bob a date of the year, in the format $DDMM$, where $DD$ is
the day and $MM$ is the month. An attacker knows this, and also has
access to Bob's public key $(N,e)$, since anyone can obtain public keys.
The attacker eavesdrops the ciphertext $\mathsf{c}$ that Alice sends
Bob, and then computes $$(DDMM)^{e}\bmod{N}$$ for each
$DD\in\{1,\dots,31\}$ and $MM\in\{1,\dots,12\}$. The attacker compares
the list of results with $\mathsf{c}$ until they find a match, which
tells them the date that was encrypted in $\mathsf{c}$. This is known as
a *chosen-plaintext attack (CPA)*, since the adversary can obtain the
encryptions of messages of their own choice. 

Below is some code for running this attack. As an attacker, we have
access to the security parameter $\lambda$, the RSA modulus `N`, and the
encryption exponent `e`. We intercept some ciphertext `c`, and
run the attack by comparing `c` with the encryption of each
possible message.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
### Auxiliary function
# Write day/month in the format DDMM
def format(day,month):
    day = str(day)
    month = str(month)
    if len(day)<2:
        day = "0" + day
    if len(month)<2:
        month = "0" + month
    return int(day + month)


### CPA attack

        if c_candidate == c:
            print("Recovered plaintext: "+str(m))
```

The version of RSA described above is known as *textbook RSA*, because
it is a version simplified for didactic purposes, but is not secure
against chosen-plaintext attacks, and thus not secure for real-world
use.

How could such an attack happened? We boil it down to three facts:

1.  The receiver's public key is known by the attacker, so the attacker
    can compute ciphertexts of messages of their choice.

2.  The set of possible messages is small, so it is efficient for the
    attacker to compute ciphertexts of every possible message.

3.  The encryption algorithm was deterministic, so the attacker can
    compare their list of ciphertexts with the intercepted ciphertext
    and find a match. Recall [Principle 3](#principle:3){reference-type="ref"
    reference="principle:3"} from the beginning of the course: there is
    no security without randomness.

Fact (1) happens by design of public-key schemes. There is not much we
can do about fact (2) either, since a good encryption scheme should
allow users to communicate any data. Therefore, to fix RSA we need to do
something about fact (3).

The idea is to modify the message before running it through the RSA
encryption algorithm, and add some randomness to it. There are many
different proposals to achieve this, collectively known as *padded RSA*.
We describe one successful variant known as *RSA-OAEP*.[^31]

Unfortunately, it is not as simple as appending some random bits at the
end of the message, and we need a more involved process. Let
$$G:\{0,1\}^{k_0}\rightarrow\{0,1\}^{\ell+k_1},\qquad H:\{0,1\}^{\ell+k_1}\rightarrow \{0,1\}^{k_0}$$
be two hash functions, where $k_0,k_1$ are such that $\lambda=O(k_0)$
and $\lambda=O(k_2)$, and $\ell+k_0+k_1$ is smaller than the bitlength
of $N$. We describe how to modify a message $\mathsf{m}$ of bitlength
$\ell$. We introduce randomness by uniformly sampling a bitstring
$r\in\{0,1\}^{k_0}$, and then compute:
$$s=\mathsf{m}|\mathbf 0^{k_1}\oplus G(r),\qquad t= r\oplus H(s),$$
where $\mathsf{m}|\mathbf 0^{k_1}$ is the bitstring $\mathsf{m}$,
concatenated with the string of zeros of length $k_1$. Then, we set the
new message as $\hat{\mathsf{m}}=(s,t)$, which is then run through
textbook RSA. Observe that $s\in\{0,1\}^{\ell+k_1}$ and
$t\in\{0,1\}^{k_0}$, so the message $\hat{\mathsf{m}}$ has the appropriate
length.

We summarize the construction in the following diagram.

```{tikz, fig.ext = 'png', fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}

With these modifications, we can finally claim that the RSA cryptosystem
is secure.

::: {.proposition}
*If the RSA problem is hard and $G$ and $H$ behave

:::

Note that the textbook version of RSA is also *malleable*. This means
that, given a ciphertext of some message, it is easy to produce a
ciphertext of a related message. For example, given a ciphertext
$\mathsf{c}$ for the message $\mathsf{m}$, i.e.
$$\mathsf{c}=\mathsf{m}^e\bmod{N},$$ an adversary can compute
$$\mathsf{c}'=2^e\mathsf{c}\bmod{N}=(2\mathsf{m})^e\bmod{N},$$ which is
a valid ciphertext for the message $2\mathsf{m}\bmod{N}$. The OAEP
transformation also makes the scheme non-malleable.

## Efficiency optimizations

As discussed above, the algorithms involved in RSA are all efficient,
although not particularly fast. In this section, we look at some
efficiency tricks to speed up the computations.

A simple one is to choose the encryption exponent $e$ so that its binary
representation has many zeros. This has an impact on the computation of
the exponentiation when the square-and-multiply algorithm
(Section \@ref(efficient-modular)) is used. Recall that,
for each bit, the algorithm consists of one squaring and, if the bit is
$1$, one multiplication, both operations modulo $n$. By choosing an
exponent like $e=2^{n}+1$, with binary representation
$$[e]_2=1\underbrace{0\dots0}_{n-1}1,$$ we ensure that we skip most of
the multiplications. In practice, often the exponent $2^{16}+1$ is
chosen.

Another possible optimization is to make use of the Chinese remainder
theorem (Proposition \@ref(prp:crt)), and perform the operations in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_q$, and then reconstruct the plaintext in $\mathbb{Z}_N$,
instead of working in $\mathbb{Z}_N$ directly. Since $p,q$ are half the
size of $N$, exponentiations are cheaper here, and overall the procedure
is roughly four times faster. More precisely, let
$\mathsf{c}\in\mathbb{Z}_N$ be a ciphertext, and let $d\in\mathbb{Z}_N$
be the secret key. We compute $$\begin{aligned}
& \mathsf{c}_p = \mathsf{c}\bmod{p} & \mathsf{c}_q = \mathsf{c}\bmod{q},\\
& d_p = d\bmod{\varphi(p)},\qquad & d_q = d\bmod{\varphi(q)},
\end{aligned}$$ and use these to decrypt in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_q$:
$$\mathsf{m}_p = \mathsf{c}_p^{d_p} \bmod{p},\qquad \mathsf{m}_q = \mathsf{c}_q^{d_q} \bmod{q}.$$
Now, we have $\mathsf{m}_p$ and $\mathsf{m}_q$, and the Chinese
remainder theorem tells us that there is a unique
$\mathsf{m}\in\mathbb{Z}_N$ such that $$\begin{aligned}
& \mathsf{m}\equiv \mathsf{m}_p \pmod{p},
& \mathsf{m}\equiv \mathsf{m}_q \pmod{q},
\end{aligned}$$ and the second part of the theorem gives us a formula to
explicitly recover such $\mathsf{m}$.

    slower. More detail can be found in Appendix \@ref(primality-testing).

    practice.
