## Set notation

A *set* is a well-defined collection of objects. Such objects are said
to be *elements* of the set, or that they *belong* to the set. For
example, the set of the vowels is
$$V=\{\text{a},\text{e},\text{i},\text{o},\text{u}\}.$$ In the above
line we are giving a name to the set, $V$, and we are specifying the
list of its elements: a, e, i, o and u. When describing a set
explicitly, we write the list of its elements between braces
$\{\hspace{0.1cm} \}$.

Two sets are equal if they have exactly the same elements. An element
cannot belong 'twice' to a set. Therefore, we can say that
$$V=\{\text{a},\text{e},\text{i},\text{o},\text{u}\}=\{\text{u},\text{o},\text{i},\text{e},\text{a}\}=\{\text{a},\text{a},\text{e},\text{e},\text{e},\text{i},\text{o},\text{u}\}.$$
The symbol $\in$ indicates membership of an element in a set. For
example, we can write a $\in V$, because a belongs to the set $V$. On
the other hand, we have that b $\not\in V$, since b is not any of the
elements of $V$.

There are some number sets that show up very frequently, so we give them
special names.

-   $\mathbb{N}$: set of natural numbers.

-   $\mathbb{Z}$: set of integer numbers.

-   $\mathbb{Q}$: set of rational numbers.

-   $\mathbb{R}$: set of real numbers.

-   $\mathbb{C}$: set of complex numbers.

Observe that, unlike in the prior examples, all these sets are
*infinite*, that is, they have an infinite number of elements. Obviously
we cannot describe an infinite set explicitly, as we have done with the
set of vowels. What we can do is refer to other sets that we have
already defined and define restrictions on them. For example, we can
define the set of even natural numbers as the set of natural numbers
that are multiples of $2$. Formally, we write this set as
$$\{n\in \mathbb{N}\mid  n=2k\text{ for some }k\in\mathbb{N}\}.$$ Here
we have introduced some new notation. Instead of explicitly enumerating
all the elements of a set, we give some conditions. We read the
description above as 'the set of elements of the form indicated on the
left of the vertical line, such that they verify the condition on the
right'. In this case, the set of natural numbers such that they are of
the form $2k$ for some natural value of $k$. Similarly, we can define
the set of all real numbers greater than $5$ in the following way:
$$\{x\in \mathbb{R}\mid  x>5\}.$$

We denote the size (number of elements) of a set $S$ by $\#S$.

We can produce new sets by considering the *product* of known sets:
given two sets $S,T$, we define the set $S\times T$ as the set whose
elements are the pairs $(s,t)$, where $s\in S$ and $t\in T$. For
example,
$$\{0,1\}\times\{0,1,2\}=\{(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)\}.$$
Observe that $\#(X\times Y)=\#X\cdot\#Y$. It is easy to generalize this
definition to products of three or more sets. In particular, given a set
$S$, we define
$$S^n=\underbrace{S\times S\times \dots \times S}_{n\text{ times}}$$ In
this course, we will often use the set $\{0,1\}$ of possible bits, the
set $\{0,1\}^\ell$ of possible bitstrings of length $\ell$, and the set
$\{0,1\}^*$ of bitstrings of any length. Observe that
$$\#\{0,1\}=2,\qquad\#\{0,1\}^\ell=2^\ell,\qquad \#\{0,1\}^*=\infty.$$

## Probability theory

We will deal with probability distributions over finite sets. In
particular, recall that the *uniform distribution* over a set $S$ is the
probability distribution that assigns the same probability $1/\#S$ to
each element of $S$. We denote sampling an element $x$ from the uniform
distribution over $S$ by $$x\gets S.$$ For example, the notation
$$\mathbf b\gets \{0,1\}^{128}$$ means that $\mathbf b$ is a uniformly
random bitstring of length $128$.

Given an event $A$, we denote the *probability of $A$* by $\Pr[A]$.
Given two events $A,B$, we denote the *probability of $A$ conditioned on
$B$* by $\Pr[A|B]$, and if $\Pr[B]\neq0$ we have that
$$\Pr[A|B]=\frac{\Pr[A\cap B]}{\Pr[B]},$$ where $\Pr[A\cap B]$ means the
probability of both $A$ and $B$ happening. Recall that, if $A$ and $B$
are independent events, then $$\Pr[A\cap B]=\Pr[A]\cdot\Pr[B].$$

## Asymptotic notation

Asymptotic notation allows us to easily express the *asymptotic
behaviour* of functions, that is, how the function changes for
arbitrarily large inputs, with respect to some other function. For
example, take the functions defined by $$f(x)=x,\qquad\qquad g(x)=x^2.$$
Both tend to infinity as $x$ tends to infinity, but the second does it
"faster". More precisely, let $$f,g:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$$ be
two functions. We write $$f(x)=O(g(x))$$ when there is some
$N,M\in\mathbb{N}$ such that, for all $x>N$, we have
$$f(x)\leq M\cdot g(x).$$ We read this as "$f$ is big-O of $g$". Then,
back to the initial example, we can say write $$x=O(x^2).$$ Note that,
because the big-O notation "absorbs" constants into $M$, we can write
$$2x=O(x),$$ even though $2x\geq x$ for $x\in\mathbb{N}$.

Big-O notation is useful for representing bounds on the growth speed of
a function. By saying, for example, that a function $f$ satisfies
$$f(x)=O(x^3),$$ we are saying that, at worst, the function $f$ grows as
fast as a cubic polynomial. Therefore, in particular, it will not grow
as fast as a polynomial of degree $4$, or an exponential function like
$2^x$.

We recall that logarithmic functions grow slower than polynomials of any
degree, and polynomials of any degree grow slower than exponential
functions. Given two polynomials of different degrees, the one with the
higher degree grows faster.
