# Ring theory {#ring-theory}

A ring is a slightly more complex algebraic structure, since it is
equipped with two operations, the first of them with the exact same
properties of a commutative group operation, whereas the second does not
require the existence of inverse.

::: {.definition}
*A* ring[^25] *is a triple $(\mathbb{K},\circ,\ast)$,
where $\mathbb{K}$ is a set and $\circ$ and $\ast$ are operations on
$\mathbb{K}$, that is, functions $$\begin{aligned}
        \circ : \phantom{a} & \mathbb{K}\times \mathbb{K}& \rightarrow & \phantom{a}\mathbb{K}& \qquad\qquad & \ast :& \mathbb{K}\times\mathbb{K}& \rightarrow & \mathbb{K}\\
                & (x,y) & \mapsto & \phantom{a} x\circ y, & & & (x,y) & \mapsto & x\ast y,
    \end{aligned}$$ which additionally satisfy the following
properties:*

1.  *$(\mathbb{K},\circ)$ is a commutative group.*

2.  *$(\mathbb{K},\ast)$ satisfies the following properties:*

    1.  Associative law: $(x\ast y)\ast z = x\ast(y\ast z)$ *for all*
        $x,y,z\in \mathbb{K}$.

    2.  Existence of identity: *there exists $e\in \mathbb{K}$ such
        that $e\ast x=x\ast e=x$ for all $x\in \mathbb{K}$. Such element
        $e$ is called the* identity element *of $\ast$.*

    3.  Commutativity: $x\ast y=y \ast x$ *for all*
        $x,y\in \mathbb{K}$.

3.  Distributive law: $x\ast(y\circ z)=(x\ast y)\circ(x\ast z)$ *for
    all* $x,y,z\in\mathbb{K}.$*
:::

Since we have two operations at the same time, we will adopt the
additive and multiplicative notation from groups to represent each of
them, respectively. That is, we will think of the first operation of a
ring as a form of *addition* and the second as a form of
*multiplication*. On input $x,y$, we write the result of the first
operation by $x+y$, and the result of the second by $xy$. The identity
elements of each operation are denoted by $0$ and $1$, respectively. The
inverse of $x$ with respect to the first operation is denoted by $-x$.
The inverse of $x$ with respect to the second operation, if exists, is
denoted by $x^{-1}$. The following table summarizes the notation:

::: {.center}
   Operation   Operation on input $x,y$   Identity element   Inverse of $x$
  ----------- -------------------------- ------------------ ----------------
      $+$               $x+y$                   $0$               $-x$
    $\cdot$              $xy$                   $1$             $x^{-1}$
:::

We consider some examples:

-   $(\mathbb{Z},+,\cdot)$, with usual integer addition and
    multiplication, is a ring, since $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ is a group with
    identity $0$, $(\mathbb{Z},\cdot)$ verifies associativity,
    commutativity and existence of identity ($1$), and it is easy to
    verify distributivity. Note, however, that $\mathbb{Z}$ does not
    contain multiplicative inverses, since for example there is no
    $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $2x=1$. For similar reasons,
    $(\mathbb{Z}_n,+,\cdot)$, with modular addition and multiplication,
    is a ring, for $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

-   $(\mathbb{Q}[X],+,\cdot)$, where $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ is the set of
    polynomials with rational coefficients in variable $X$, $+$ is
    point-wise addition, and $\cdot$ is point-wise multiplication, is
    also a ring. The identity elements are the constant polynomials
    $p(X)=0$ and $q(X)=1$, respectively.

Consider the ring $\mathbb{Z}_9$, with addition and multiplication
modulo $9$. The following table gives the multiplicative inverses of
each element:

::: {.center}
         $x$  $0$   $1$   $2$   $3$   $4$   $5$   $6$   $7$   $8$
  ---------- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
    $x^{-1}$  $-$   $1$   $5$   $-$   $7$   $2$   $-$   $4$   $8$
:::

Note that some elements are not invertible, in this case $0$, $3$ and
$6$. Those elements in a ring that happen to have a multiplicative
inverse receive a special name.

::: {.definition}
*Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a ring. An element
$x\in\mathbb{K}$ that has a multiplicative inverse is called a* unit*.
We denote the set of units of $\mathbb{K}$ by $\mathbb{K}^*$.*
:::

Note that the only thing that $(\mathbb{K},\cdot)$ was missing to be a
group is existence of inverses. By restricting ourselves to the subset
$\mathbb{K}^*$ of invertible elements, we have that
$(\mathbb{K}^*,\cdot)$ is a group. Note that, in the previous lesson, we
defined $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ to be the set of invertible elements of
$\mathbb{Z}_n$, so in this new formulation, we can state that
$\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ is actually the set of units of $\mathbb{Z}_n$.
Moreover, we now know that $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ is a group with
multiplication modulo $n$.

In light of the discussion above, we start this section by asking
ourselves the following question.

::: {.problem}
*Is it possible to have a ring $\mathbb{K}$ in which all
the elements are invertible?*
:::

This will never be the case, unless the ring only contains one element,
since the additive identity $0$ cannot have a multiplicative inverse
otherwise. To see this, assume that there exists $x\in\mathbb{K}$ such
that $0\cdot x = 1$. First, $$0x=(1+(-1))x=x+(-x)=0,$$ using the
distributive law and the properties of the multiplicative identity $1$.
Then we have that $1=0$. But then, this means that $$x=1x=0x=0,$$ using
the properties of the multiplicative and additive identities. Thus, we
conclude that every element is the same. And rings with just one element
are not very interesting.

So, except for the trivial case, we know that $0$ cannot have an
inverse. What about the rest of the elements? In this case, the answer
is affirmative: there exist rings in which every non-zero element is
invertible, and we call those *fields*.

::: {.definition}
*A* field *is a ring in which every non-zero element
has a multiplicative inverse in the ring.*

## Set notation

A *set* is a well-defined collection of objects. Such objects are said
to be *elements* of the set, or that they *belong* to the set. For
example, the set of the vowels is
$$V=\{\text{a},\text{e},\text{i},\text{o},\text{u}\}.$$ In the above
line we are giving a name to the set, $V$, and we are specifying the
list of its elements: a, e, i, o and u. When describing a set
explicitly, we write the list of its elements between braces
$\{\hspace{0.1cm} \}$.

Two sets are equal if they have exactly the same elements. An element
cannot belong 'twice' to a set. Therefore, we can say that
$$V=\{\text{a},\text{e},\text{i},\text{o},\text{u}\}=\{\text{u},\text{o},\text{i},\text{e},\text{a}\}=\{\text{a},\text{a},\text{e},\text{e},\text{e},\text{i},\text{o},\text{u}\}.$$
The symbol $\in$ indicates membership of an element in a set. For
example, we can write a $\in V$, because a belongs to the set $V$. On
the other hand, we have that b $\not\in V$, since b is not any of the
elements of $V$.

There are some number sets that show up very frequently, so we give them
special names.

-   $\mathbb{N}$: set of natural numbers.

-   $\mathbb{Z}$: set of integer numbers.

-   $\mathbb{Q}$: set of rational numbers.

-   $\mathbb{R}$: set of real numbers.

-   $\mathbb{C}$: set of complex numbers.

Observe that, unlike in the prior examples, all these sets are
*infinite*, that is, they have an infinite number of elements. Obviously
we cannot describe an infinite set explicitly, as we have done with the
set of vowels. What we can do is refer to other sets that we have
already defined and define restrictions on them. For example, we can
define the set of even natural numbers as the set of natural numbers
that are multiples of $2$. Formally, we write this set as
$$\{n\in \mathbb{N}\mid  n=2k\text{ for some }k\in\mathbb{N}\}.$$ Here
we have introduced some new notation. Instead of explicitly enumerating
all the elements of a set, we give some conditions. We read the
description above as 'the set of elements of the form indicated on the
left of the vertical line, such that they verify the condition on the
right'. In this case, the set of natural numbers such that they are of
the form $2k$ for some natural value of $k$. Similarly, we can define
the set of all real numbers greater than $5$ in the following way:
$$\{x\in \mathbb{R}\mid  x>5\}.$$

We denote the size (number of elements) of a set $S$ by $\#S$.

We can produce new sets by considering the *product* of known sets:
given two sets $S,T$, we define the set $S\times T$ as the set whose
elements are the pairs $(s,t)$, where $s\in S$ and $t\in T$. For
example,
$$\{0,1\}\times\{0,1,2\}=\{(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)\}.$$
Observe that $\#(X\times Y)=\#X\cdot\#Y$. It is easy to generalize this
definition to products of three or more sets. In particular, given a set
$S$, we define
$$S^n=\underbrace{S\times S\times \dots \times S}_{n\text{ times}}$$ In
this course, we will often use the set $\{0,1\}$ of possible bits, the
set $\{0,1\}^\ell$ of possible bitstrings of length $\ell$, and the set
$\{0,1\}^*$ of bitstrings of any length. Observe that
$$\#\{0,1\}=2,\qquad\#\{0,1\}^\ell=2^\ell,\qquad \#\{0,1\}^*=\infty.$$

::: {.exercise}
*Write these sets using implicit notation:*

-   *The set of complex numbers with real part equal to $1$.*

-   *The set of pairs, where the first component of the pair is a
    rational number and the second component is an odd natural number.*

-   *The set of bitstrings of length $10$ with exactly $5$ zeros.*

## Probability theory

We will deal with probability distributions over finite sets. In
particular, recall that the *uniform distribution* over a set $S$ is the
probability distribution that assigns the same probability $1/\#S$ to
each element of $S$. We denote sampling an element $x$ from the uniform
distribution over $S$ by $$x\gets S.$$ For example, the notation
$$\mathbf b\gets \{0,1\}^{128}$$ means that $\mathbf b$ is a uniformly
random bitstring of length $128$.

Given an event $A$, we denote the *probability of $A$* by $\Pr[A]$.
Given two events $A,B$, we denote the *probability of $A$ conditioned on
$B$* by $\Pr[A|B]$, and if $\Pr[B]\neq0$ we have that
$$\Pr[A|B]=\frac{\Pr[A\cap B]}{\Pr[B]},$$ where $\Pr[A\cap B]$ means the
probability of both $A$ and $B$ happening. Recall that, if $A$ and $B$
are independent events, then $$\Pr[A\cap B]=\Pr[A]\cdot\Pr[B].$$

::: {.exercise}
*Compute the probability of a random bitstring of
length $4$ being the string $1110$.*
:::

## Asymptotic notation

Asymptotic notation allows us to easily express the *asymptotic
behaviour* of functions, that is, how the function changes for
arbitrarily large inputs, with respect to some other function. For
example, take the functions defined by $$f(x)=x,\qquad\qquad g(x)=x^2.$$
Both tend to infinity as $x$ tends to infinity, but the second does it
"faster". More precisely, let $$f,g:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$$ be
two functions. We write $$f(x)=O(g(x))$$ when there is some
$N,M\in\mathbb{N}$ such that, for all $x>N$, we have
$$f(x)\leq M\cdot g(x).$$ We read this as "$f$ is big-O of $g$". Then,
back to the initial example, we can say write $$x=O(x^2).$$ Note that,
because the big-O notation "absorbs" constants into $M$, we can write
$$2x=O(x),$$ even though $2x\geq x$ for $x\in\mathbb{N}$.

Big-O notation is useful for representing bounds on the growth speed of
a function. By saying, for example, that a function $f$ satisfies
$$f(x)=O(x^3),$$ we are saying that, at worst, the function $f$ grows as
fast as a cubic polynomial. Therefore, in particular, it will not grow
as fast as a polynomial of degree $4$, or an exponential function like
$2^x$.

We recall that logarithmic functions grow slower than polynomials of any
degree, and polynomials of any degree grow slower than exponential
functions. Given two polynomials of different degrees, the one with the
higher degree grows faster.

::: {.exercise}
*Decide whether each of these statements is true or
false.*

-   *$10^{10}x^3=O(x^4)$.*

-   *$10^x=O(x^4)$.*

-   *$\log(x)=O(x\log x)$.*

-   *$4^x=O(2^x)$.*

## Polynomial division {#polydiv}

Consider two polynomials $$\begin{split}
    & A(X)=a_kX^k+a_{k-1}X^{k-1}+\dots+a_1X+a_0, \\
    & B(X)=b_{\ell}X^{\ell}+b_{\ell-1}X^{\ell-1}+\dots+b_1X+b_0, \\
\end{split}$$ where $k\geq\ell$. Then, we have the following result.

```{proposition, label=polydiv}
*Let $A(X)$ and $B(X)$ be the polynomials defined
above. Then, there exist polynomials $Q(X)$ and $R(X)$ such that
$$A(X)=B(X)Q(X)+R(X),$$ where the degree of $R$ is smaller than $\ell$.
In this case, $Q$ is called the* quotient *and $R$ is called the* remainder *of the division.*
```

The algorithm is very similar to the algorithm of integer division. The
idea is to try to find factors such that, when multiplied by $B(X)$,
allow us to remove the highest-degree term left in $A(X)$, and use these
terms to build $Q(X)$. Although very simple, the idea is cumbersome to
explain for general polynomials, so we illustrate it with an example.
Let $$A(X)=3X^5+X^4+2X^2+7,\qquad B(X)=X^3+X^2+X.$$ We arrange them in
the usual diagram: $$\begin{array}{rrrrrrl}
    3X^5 & +x^4 & & +2x^2 & & +7 \qquad &  |\quad X^3+X^2+X\\
     &&&&&& \overline{\phantom{|\quad  X^3+X^2+X}} \\
\end{array}$$ We want to remove $3X^5$, so we try to find a factor
$f(X)$ such that $f(X)X^3=3X^5$. Thus, we choose $f(X)=3X^2$, multiply
it by $B(X)$, and subtract the result from $A(X)$, obtaining a
lower-degree polynomial: $$\begin{array}{rrrrrrl}
    3X^5 & +X^4 & & +2X^2 & & +7 \qquad &  |\quad X^3+X^2+X\\
     &&&&&& \overline{\phantom{|\quad  X^3+X^2+X}} \\
      & -2X^4 & -3X^3 & +2X^2 &  &+ 7 \qquad & 3X^2\\
\end{array}$$ We now look at the new polynomial, $-2X^4-3X^3+2X^2+7$,
and again try to remove the highest-degree monomial, which we achieve by
multiplying $X^3$ by $-2X$. $$\begin{array}{rrrrrrl}
    3X^5 & +X^4 & & +2X^2 & & +7 \qquad &  |\quad X^3+X^2+X\\
     &&&&&& \overline{\phantom{|\quad  X^3+X^2+X}} \\
      & -2X^4 & -3X^3 & +2X^2 &  &+ 7 \qquad & 3X^2-2X\\
      &&&&&& {\phantom{|\quad  X^3+X^2+X}} \\
     & & -X^3 + 4X^2 &&&+ 7 \qquad & \\
\end{array}$$ Again, we want to remove the term $-X^3$, so we multiply
$B(X)$ by $-1$: $$\begin{array}{rrrrrrl}
    3X^5 & +X^4 & & +2X^2 & & +7 \qquad &  |\quad X^3+X^2+X\\
     &&&&&& \overline{\phantom{|\quad  X^3+X^2+X}} \\
      & -2X^4 & -3X^3 & +2X^2 &  &+ 7 \qquad & 3X^2-2X-1\\
      &&&&&& {\phantom{|\quad  X^3+X^2+X}} \\
     & & -X^3 + 4X^2 &&&+ 7 \qquad & \\
     &&&&&& {\phantom{|\quad  X^3+X^2+X}} \\
     & & & 5X^2 & +X & +7 \qquad & \\
\end{array}$$ Since the degree of the current dividend is smaller than
the degree of the divisor, we are done. We conclude that the quotient of
the division of $A(X)$ by $B(X)$ is $$3X^2-2X-1,$$ and the remainder is
$$5X^2+X+7.$$ Note that the above example works in $\mathbb{Q}$, but in
general operations on the coefficients must take into account which
field we are in. For example, if our coefficients are in $\mathbb{F}_5$,
we cannot "divide" by $3$, but we can find the inverse of $3$ modulo
$5$, and we must ensure that every coefficient is reduced modulo $5$.

[^25]: *In an abstract algebra context, the definition of a ring is more
    general, and what we are defining is known as a *commutative ring
    with unity*. Nevertheless, we stick to this definition for
    simplicity, since it is the only type of ring relevant to us.*
