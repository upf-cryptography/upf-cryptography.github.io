# Block ciphers

In this section, we focus on block ciphers, which are a more popular
alternative to stream ciphers. Block ciphers are interesting not only
for encryption, but they also have some interesting theoretical
implications, since many other cryptographic primitives (like
pseudorandom generators) can be built from block ciphers. In this
section, we will learn:

1.  What is a block cipher, and what are the properties of a good block
    cipher;

2.  The different modes of operation of a block cipher;

3.  Two prime examples of block ciphers: DES and AES.

## Overview of block ciphers

Recall that the one-time pad, and stream ciphers in general, encrypt
bits one by one. In contrast, block ciphers will split our plaintext in
blocks of fixed length, and encrypt each of this as a single unit.

::: {.definition}
*A* block cipher of length $\ell$ *is an encryption
scheme that encrypts a message of fixed length* $\ell$.
:::

When encrypting an arbitrarily large message, we will split it into
blocks of length $\ell$ and encrypt each block, using the same key,
unlike in the previous section where we tried to stretch the key.
Because of this, we will require a good block cipher to satisfy two new
properties, that we informally describe below:

-   *Confusion:* each bit of the ciphertext depends on several parts of
    the key. In other words, the relation between key and ciphertext
    must not be clear to any attacker.

-   *Diffusion:* small changes in the plaintext result in significant
    changes in the ciphertext. More precisely, in any modern block
    cipher, it is expected that a single bit change in the plaintext
    should result in at least half of the bits of the ciphertext
    changing.

Later in this section, we will see some concrete examples of block
ciphers used in practice. For now, let us assume that we already have
some block cipher $$(\mathsf{KeyGen},\mathsf{Enc},\mathsf{Dec}),$$ that
we will use as a black box. That is, for now we do not know what happens
inside each of the algorithms, only that they work and they are secure.
For example, we assume that $\mathsf{Enc}$ takes as input a plaintext
$\mathsf{m}$ of length $\ell$ and produces a ciphertext $\mathsf{c}$
corresponding to $\mathsf{m}$. We represent this by the diagram

```{tikz, fig.ext = 'png', fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, node distance=2cm,>=latex']
    \node [input, name=input] {};
    \node [block, right of=input, pin={[pinstyle]above:$\mathsf{k}$},
            node distance=2cm] (enc) {$\mathsf{Enc}$}; block. 
    \node [output, right of=enc] (output) {};
    
    \draw [draw,->] (input) -- node {$\mathsf{m}$} (enc);
    \draw [->] (enc) -- node [name=y] {$\mathsf{c}$}(output);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

This will allow us to discuss block ciphers in a
more general way.

## Modes of operation

Assume that we want to encrypt a message $\mathsf{m}$ of length $\ell n$
with a block cipher. When the message length is not a multiple of the
block length, some extra bytes are added to complete the last block.
This is called *padding*.[^10] We start by splitting the message in
blocks $$\mathsf{m}_1,\dots,\mathsf{m}_n,$$ each of them of length
$\ell$, so that they can be fed into our block cipher. The question is:
do we encrypt each block in parallel? Is that secure? Or should we
somehow make the blocks influence each other? The way we proceed here is
determined by the *mode of operation* that we choose.

### Electronic codebook (ECB) mode

In ECB mode, we take the most straightforward approach, and encrypt each
block on its own: $$\mathsf{c}_i=\mathsf{Enc}_k(\mathsf{m}_i).$$ The ECB
mode is represented in the following diagram:
```{tikz, fig.ext = 'png', fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, node distance=2cm,>=latex']
    % We start by placing the blocks
    \node [input, name=input] {};
    \node [block, right of=input, pin={[pinstyle]above:$\mathsf{k}$},
            node distance=2cm] (enc) {$\mathsf{Enc}$};
    % We draw an edge between the controller and system block to 
    % calculate the coordinate u. We need it to place the measurement block. 
    \node [output, right of=enc] (output) {};

    % Once the nodes are placed, connecting them is easy. 
    \draw [draw,->] (input) -- node {$\mathsf{m}_i$} (enc);
    \draw [->] (enc) -- node [name=y] {$\mathsf{c}_i$}(output);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

The main advantage of this approach is that, since each block is
independent, we can make the operations in parallel, potentially saving
computation time.

However, this mode presents several weaknesses. For example, since each
block is encrypted in exactly the same way, two identical messages
result in two identical ciphertexts. So an eavesdropper can see when the
same message was sent twice. Even if he does not know the content, this
provides the attacker with some partial information, which is something
that we would like to avoid.

Furthermore, the ECB mode is particularly bad when encrypting
"meaningful" information. A very visual example comes from encrypting an
image. Assume that we split the image into small squares of pixels, so
that the bit length of each of these matches the length of our block
cipher, and then use ECB-mode encryption on each square. Below you can
see the result on an example image.[^11]

:::

Because the blocks are encrypted independently, a human eye can still
easily distinguish the underlying information. This illustrates ECB
mode's lack of diffusion.

### Cipher block chaining (CBC) mode

So we have seen that we want our blocks to interact in some way. To
achieve this, the CBC mode takes the following approach: the idea is to
create a *feedback loop*, in which each ciphertext produced by the block
cipher is fed back into the input of the next iteration, by computing
the $\mathsf{XOR}$ with the new input. More precisely:
$$\mathsf{c}_i=\mathsf{Enc}_k(\mathsf{m}_i\oplus \mathsf{c}_{i-1}).$$
The CBC mode is represented in the following diagram:
```{tikz, fig.ext = 'png', fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, node distance=2cm,>=latex']
    % We start by placing the blocks
    \node [input, name=input] {};
    \node [xor, right of=input] (xor) {$\bigoplus$};
    \node [block, right of=xor, pin={[pinstyle]above:$\mathsf{k}$},
            node distance=2cm] (enc) {$\mathsf{Enc}$};
    % We draw an edge between the controller and system block to 
    % calculate the coordinate u. We need it to place the measurement block. 
    \node [output, right of=enc] (output) {};

    % Once the nodes are placed, connecting them is easy. 
    \draw [draw,->] (input) -- node {$\mathsf{m}_i$} (xor);
    \draw [->] (xor) -- node {} (enc);
    \draw [->] (enc) -- node [name=y] {$\mathsf{c}_i$}(output);
    \draw [->] (y)  -- +(0,-1.5) -| (xor);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Note that this does not work for the first block, since there is no
previous ciphertext, and so we introduce something to replace it, which
we call the *initialization vector* (often denoted by IV). By choosing
the IV at random, we also introduce randomness in our scheme, making the
procedure non-deterministic. Observe also that, due to the recursive
nature of the definition, the encryption of a block is not only
influenced by the previous block, but by *every* block that came before,
and also the IV. There is no need for the IV to be secret, although it
should not be reused, so if a new encryption sessions starts, a new IV
should be chosen.

With this approach, we achieve a much higher diffusion. Looking again at
the same picture, the result is now very different:

::: {.center}
![image](Tux.jpg)![image](Tux_secure.jpg)
:::

This is due to the fact that the encryption of each block influences the
next. Thus, two identical blocks (for example, two squares of white in
the corner of the picture) do not produce the same output anymore. The
downside of this approach is that, since we need a ciphertext before we
can compute the next, we cannot parallelize the computations.

### Output feedback (OFB) mode

The next mode of operation actually turns a block cipher into a stream
cipher, by recomputing a key each time through the $\mathsf{Enc}$
algorithm. That is, it is a stream cipher in which the key stream is
produced in blocks of length $\ell$: $$\begin{aligned}
& \mathbf w_i = \mathsf{Enc}_k(\mathbf w_{i-1}), \\
& \mathsf{c}_i=\mathsf{m}_i\oplus \mathbf w_i. \\
\end{aligned}$$ The OFB mode is represented in the following diagram:
```{tikz, fig.ext = 'png', fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, node distance=2cm,>=latex']
    % We start by placing the blocks
    \node [input, name=f_input] {};
    \node [below of=f_input, name=input] {$\mathsf{m}_i$};
    \node [block, right of=f_input, pin={[pinstyle]above:$\mathsf{k}$},
            node distance=2cm] (enc) {$\mathsf{Enc}$};
    \node [xor, right of=enc] (xor) {$\bigoplus$};
    % We draw an edge between the controller and system block to 
    % calculate the coordinate u. We need it to place the measurement block. 
    \node [output, right of=xor] (output) {};

    % Once the nodes are placed, connecting them is easy. 
    \draw [draw,->] (input) -| node {} (xor);
    \draw [->] (enc) -- node [name=y] {$\mathbf{w}_i$}(xor);
    \draw [->] (xor) -- node [name=z] {$\mathsf{c}_i$}(output);
    \draw [] (y)  -- +(0,-1.5) -|  (f_input);
    \draw [->] (f_input)  --  (enc);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Again, we need an IV to feed into $\mathsf{Enc}$ in the first iteration.
Observe that the block cipher and the feedback loop do not involve the
message at all, which is simply $\mathsf{XOR}$'ed with the result of
each iteration of the loop to produce the ciphertext, as in any stream
cipher.

While, as the CBC mode, the computation cannot be performed in parallel,
the fact that the loop does not depend on the message at all allows us
to precompute a bunch of key blocks in advance, for later use with a
message.

### Counter (CTR) mode

Similarly to the OFB mode, the CTR mode produces a stream cipher from a
block cipher. It works by keeping a public counter $\mathsf{ctr}$ that
is chosen randomly, and is increased by $1$ after each iteration. The
counter works as an IV that updates after encrypting each block.
$$\begin{aligned}
    & \mathsf{ctr}_i = \mathsf{ctr}_{i-1}+1, \\
    & \mathsf{c}_i=\mathsf{m}_i\oplus \mathsf{Enc}_k(\mathsf{ctr}_i). \\
    \end{aligned}$$ After the last iteration, the current value of the
counter is also sent, together with the ciphertext. The CTR mode is
represented in the following diagram:
```{tikz, fig.ext = 'png', fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, node distance=1cm,>=latex']
    % We start by placing the blocks
    \node [input, name=f_input] {};
    \node [below of=f_input, name=ff_input] {};
    \node [below of=ff_input, name=input] {$\mathsf{m}_i$};
    \node [right of=f_input, name=plus, pin={[pinstyle]above:$1$}] {$\scalebox{1.5}{+}$};
    \node [block, right of=plus, pin={[pinstyle]above:$\mathsf{k}$},
            node distance=2cm] (enc) {$\mathsf{Enc}$};
    \node [xor, right of=enc, name=xor] {$\bigoplus$};
    \node [output, right of=xor] (output) {};
    
    \draw [draw,->] (input) -| node {} (xor);
    \draw [->] (plus) -- node [name=y] {$\mathsf{ctr}_i$}(enc);
    \draw [->] (xor) -- node [name=z] {$\mathsf{c}_i$}(output);
    \draw [] (y)  -- +(0,-1.5) -|  (f_input);
    \draw [->] (f_input)  --  (plus);
    \draw [->] (enc)  --  (xor);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

::: {.exercise}
*We have not discussed the decryption procedure of any
of the modes of operation. Given a $\mathsf{Dec}$ algorithm that
recovers plaintexts encrypted with $\mathsf{Enc}$, describe how
decryption works for each mode of operation. Recall that the values of
the IV and counter are public.*

## DES and AES

Now that we know how to use block ciphers, let us look a bit into some
of the most famous ones: the *Data Encryption Standard (DES)*, and its
successor the *Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)*. DES was designed by
a team at IBM in 1974, and became the first official encryption standard
in the US in 1977. It remained as the recommended encryption scheme
until 1999, when it was replaced by AES.[^12]

### Data Encryption Standard (DES)

DES is a block cipher of length $64$, which uses a key of $56$ bits.
Essentially, it is composed of $16$ identical rounds, each of them
consisting of the following. During each round, a *round key*
$\mathsf{k}_i$ of 48 bits is derived from the master key. In round $i$,
the algorithm receives $\mathsf{m}_{i-1}$, the output of the previous
round (or the original message, for $i=1$), and computes $\mathsf{m}_i$,
the output of the current round. In between, the following step happen:

1.  Split $\mathsf{m}_{i-1}$ in two halves
    $\mathbf L_{i-1}, \mathbf R_{i-1}$ of 32 bits each.

2.  Derive the round key $\mathsf{k}_i$ from $\mathsf{k}$.

3.  Set $\mathbf L_{i}=R_{i-1}$ and
    $\mathbf R_{i}=L_{i-1}\oplus f(\mathbf R_{i-1},\mathsf{k}_i)$.

4.  Return $\mathbf m_i=(\mathbf L_i, \mathbf R_i)$

After round $16$, the end result $\mathsf{m}_{16}$ is the ciphertext.

Decryption of DES is almost the same as encryption, starting from the
last round key. Observe that one half of the input of each round is not
encrypted, just moved around, and so in total each half of the plaintext
is encrypted $8$ times by $\mathsf{XOR}$'ing it with a function of the
round key. There are a couple of details that we have not specified yet:

-   How to derive round keys from the master key $\mathsf{k}$. Without
    getting into much detail, the $\mathsf{k}_i$ is obtained from
    $\mathsf{k}$ by performing some rotations and permutations on the
    positions of the bits, and then some bits are ignored.

-   How the function $f$ works. First, the function expands the 32-bit
    input $\mathbf R_{i-1}$ to a 48-bit string, by repeating some of the
    bits in specified positions. The result is then $\mathsf{XOR}$'ed
    with the round key $\mathsf{k}_i$. The result from this operation is
    then split into $8$ blocks of $6$ bits each, and fed into what is
    known as *substitution boxes (S-boxes)*, which are functions
    specified by a lookup table. Each box outputs a string of 4 bits, so
    in total we have a string of $32$ bits. Finally, the positions of
    the bits in this string are permuted, and the result is the output
    of the function $f$.

The design of the cipher, specially the function $f$, might look arcane.
Indeed, since the design and standardization of DES was not a public
process, the reason behind some design choices is still not completely
clear. What is known, however, is that the $f$ function and the
$S$-boxes were designed to thwart any attack known at the time (and even
some that were not known to the public). The takeaway message here is
that the $S$-boxes and the final permutation play a big role in
achieving a good level of diffusion, propagating change through the
whole ciphertext in the following rounds. Indeed, we have the following
result.

::: {.proposition}
*By the end of the fifth round of DES, every single
bit of the current ciphertext depends on all the bits of the plaintext
and all the bits of the key.*
:::

No sophisticated efficient attacks are known against DES to date.
However, the key size is simply too small for today's standards (look
again at the table at the end of
section \@ref(introduction-to-security)), and so it was eventually
replaced by AES. Some variants of DES, like 3DES, which essentially
means applying DES three times in a row, are still in use, and have
withstood any attacks so far.

### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

AES is a block cipher with block length $128$ bits. Unlike DES, which
used $56$-bit keys, AES supports keys of bit length $128$, $192$ and
$256$, and has between $10$ and $14$ rounds, depending on the key
length. Moreover, while in DES only half of the block was encrypted in
each round, the full block is encrypted in every round now. On a very
high level, each round consists of the following steps, called *layers*:

1.  *Key addition layer:* a round key of length $128$ is derived from
    the master key, in a process called *key schedule*.

2.  *Byte substitution layer:* similarly to DES, AES uses $16$ S-boxes
    defined by lookup tables, replacing each byte of the message by a
    new byte specified by the corresponding $S$-box. This layer
    introduces confusion.

3.  *Diffusion layer:* the position of the bytes are permuted. Then,
    blocks of four bytes are combined using some matrix operations.

Regarding security, no attack more efficient than brute force is known
to date. Thus, the security level provided by AES is $\lambda$, where
$\lambda\in\{128,192,256\}$ is the bit size of the key.

The following video has a very clear and concise overview of the inner
workings of AES.
